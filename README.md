## What is metabolic syndrome? 
### Metabolic syndrome is a group of five conditions that can lead to heart disease, diabetes, stroke and other health problems. 
### Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when someone has three or more of these risk factors: 

- High blood glucose (sugar). 
  - Fasting glucose: ≥100 mg/dL
- High levels of triglycerides in the blood.
  -  Triglycerides: ≥150 mg/dL.
- High blood pressure 
  - Blood pressure: ≥135/≥85 mm Hg
- Large waist circumference or “apple-shaped” body.
  - Men  >102 cm (>40 in)
  - Women  >88 cm (>35 in)
- Low levels of HDL (“good”). cholesterol in the blood. 
  -  Men <40 mg/dL
  -  Women <50 mg/dL
