# Predicting Metabolic Syndrome

- Author: Kevin Ridge

## Goal for Project:
- Create machine learning models to predict if someone has metabolic syndrome.

This data comes from the National Center for Statistics.

What is metabolic syndrome? 
- Metabolic syndrome is a group of five conditions that can lead to heart disease, diabetes, stroke and other health problems. 
- Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when someone has three or more of these risk factors: 

  - High blood glucose (sugar)
  - Low levels of HDL (“good”) cholesterol in the blood
  - High levels of triglycerides in the blood
  - Large waist circumference or “apple-shaped” body
  - High blood pressure
